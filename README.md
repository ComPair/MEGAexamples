# MEGAexamples
Example simulation files run with the MEGA prototype in MEGAlib

#Example 1
See EffectiveArea-RevanOutput.txt for details

#Note: File size  
Files have to be smaller than 100 MB - which makes sense, however, most simulation files are not that small. 
I have a practice simulation file on my slac account: 
/afs/slac/g/glast/users/rcaputo/MEGAlib/MEGAlib/workdir/MEGAexampleAEFF/EffectiveArea_2MeV.inc1.id1.sim

That's probably what we need to start using the python code
